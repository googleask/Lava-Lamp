{"name":"Lava lamp navigation","tagline":"Create a drop down menu with a lava lamp using Jquery","body":"## Introduction\r\nThis project will help you how to create a lava lamp navigation menu using Jquery.This is not a Jquery plugin,however its ease of use is impressive.\r\n## Usage\r\n### HTML\r\nTo use it use need to create a markup first,for this make a `div` with a `class='nav'`.\r\n`<div class='nav'>\r\n....\r\n</div>`\r\nUnder this you just have to follow a traditional markup of navigations that is using `ul` and `li`.For child elements,add them under the `li` of a parent as I done below:\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href='#'>Home</a></li>\r\n<li><a href='#'>Parent</a>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href='#'>Child 1</a></li>\r\n<li><a href='#'>Child 2</a></li>\r\n<li><a href='#'>Child 3</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n### CSS\r\nThe CSS is quite simple to handle all you need to do is to just copy the whole CSS and paste in your page.If you want to change colour of the lamp then you need to do a few changes.\r\n\r\nFirst do change `background-color` of `.lamp span`\r\n```\r\n.lamp span {\r\n    display:block;\r\n    height:4px;\r\n    background:#ee6666;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSecondly change the `border-bottom-color` in the below part.\r\n```\r\n.lamp span:after {\r\n    bottom: 100%;\r\n    left: 50%;\r\n    border: solid transparent;\r\n    content:\" \";\r\n    height: 0;\r\n    width: 0;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    pointer-events: none;\r\n    border-color: rgba(238, 102, 102, 0);\r\n    border-bottom-color: #ee6666;\r\n    border-width: 4px;\r\n    margin-left: -4px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Jquery\r\nTheir is no need of changing the Jquery,but a point need to be discussed here.\r\n\r\nIf their is a link that is currently open in navigation menu then it should be classed as `selected` because according to script,the lamp will stay under the element having a class `selected`.If their is no element having class `selected` then lamp will always stay at the first element,that is generally home link.\r\n## Contributor\r\nThe script is written by [Mohammad Hamza](http://google.com/+mohammadhamzadhamiya),author of [Blogger Ever](http://bloggerever.com).\r\n## License\r\nThis script is under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
